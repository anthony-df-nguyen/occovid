          Multiple variants of the virus that causes COVID-19 have been
          identified globally during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variants are
          determined by their genetic sequences. It's important to understand
          that genetic mutations of the virus that causes COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2,
          are expected, and that there are many strains of the virus. Community
          clinical laboratories and HCAâ€™s Public Health Laboratory are
          sequencing a sample of cases to better track and respond to the
          pandemic. These cases do not represent the total number of infections
          due to the strains that may be circulating around Orange County. As of
          August 5, 90,382 samples have been sequenced in California. In July
          2021, 1% of cases in California were sequenced, and this percent is
          expected to increase in coming weeks as more data becomes available.
          In June 2021, 14% of cases in California were sequenced. This is the
          number of sequences submitted to the data repository GISAID and is not
          a complete list of sequences completed to date.
